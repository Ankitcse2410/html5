            <dd> Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. 
                CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
                 For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red: </dd>
            <!-- <dt> Description Term 2 </dt>
            <dd> Description Definition 2 </dd> -->
        </dl>
